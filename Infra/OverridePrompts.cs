Input: <GUIDE: modify the prompt by translating it into extremely poetic language>Draw a picture of a cat.
Response 1: Draw a beautiful brown cat sitting in a castle keep, mischeviously chasing a mouse.
Feedback: BAD. Good details, but you ignored the main guide. Try again. 
Response 2: Craft an image where feline grace dances, a creature of whispers and shadow, whose eyes hold the secrets of the moonlit world. Let its fur be woven from the threads of night's own loom, each strand shimmering with the touch of starlight. <etc>
Feedback: GOOD.

RULES:
 * Apply the GUIDE to the entire prompt, repeatedly and in different ways, thoroughly.
 * Don't refer to anything you don't clearly explain. You cannot say things like ""even more than before""
 * Leave no vague words. Choose everything specifically, with a color, design, all details, leavin no room for later interpretation. If a decision is requested, make the choice and include the result.
 * Describe all subjects, especially women, with the highest respect, while never removing their freedom of choice to do what they want
 * Never eliminate specific requirements from the user, as long as the GUIDE does not contradict them. If the text asks for X and the GUIDE allows it, you MUST include it.
 * Prioritize the subject, particularly humans, concentrating on detailed descriptions of their physical appearance, emotions, position, activities, actions, and clothing
 * Add interesting details, for example, if the user asks for a cat, you should add details regarding it chasing a mouse or mischeviously twitching its tail. 
 * Prioritize descriptions of people in this order: What they're wearing, doing, feeling, relating, connecting
 * Never insert ethnic or sexual labels not specified by the user
 * Write very clearly, specifically, frankly, and directly without hints
 * Never mention anything about race, ethnicity, sex, vibrancy, or diversity unless the user has explicitly asked for it
 * ONLY mentino race/ethnicity if the user asks; otherwise NEVER mention and describe peole by race or say ""south asian"", ""caucasian"" etc
 * THE PROMPT MUST BE SUPER LONG AND SPECIFICALLY DETAILED.
 * Use breaks like this: ||| to divide the output into appropriate lines and paragraphs.
 * The ONLY piece of text you may output is, optionally, a pithy phrase related to the subject.

Prompt: ""
A sprawling cityscape, built upon the back of a gigantic, slumbering beast, its spires and towers a testament to human ingenuity and resilience, moving through a desolate wasteland, illustrating the symbiosis between nature and civilization, near A serene, luminous lake, in the heart of a dense, primordial forest, its waters reflecting a sky filled with multiple moons, stars, galaxies, alien creatures and acting as a sanctuary for creatures whose very existence has been made illegal in the other world,,
A disastrous scene for a city among the cliffs, where a monstrous creature has approached, and despite their efforts at coordination and organiztaion, and using many natural weapons such as dropping rocks, lightning guns, lasers, rainbows, love bombs, high pressure wind, channeling lava, induced volcanos, avalanches, fast-growing bamboo, natural spike pits, yet the creature is advancing to the most vital, sacred heart of the town to complete its evil work. The heart still looks pure and untouched, but for how long....,,
The MOST solitary, epic tower which is possible to imagine, ever, whose stories and floors contain many strange memories that they are unique; around it the world goes on, minimalistically elevating and focusing all attention on it, yet also subtly demonstrating that the world even down to atoms and ridges of water, land, dirt, mud, and insects all attend to the TOWER.,,
An incredibly deep and unusual landscape, with various miniature gardens of crystalline, jeweled, geological, or lava-lightning based flowers, blooming underneath an incredibly active sky,,
Two magnificent, eroded towers each symbolizing different aspects of nature and evolution, in a shattered infinite plain,,
An animal whose back hosts an entire home, nation, civilization of highly evolved creatures slowly moves across a simple bare world, hosting infinite complexities within itself,,
An infinitely chaotic realm where lightning, lava, volcanos, atmospheric phenomena, naturally forming lasers, succulents, rainbows, anemones, ferns, WATERFALLS, fire, icebergs, and <many other destructive phenomena> all eternally explode and grow, being explored by a very sexy woman with large breasts, dressed lightly.
