# cmdline-dalle3-csharp

Two functions:
===

It can conveniently contact dalle3 and make images for you on the command line.

It can take options like --N to make multiple at a time.

It can also expand permutations like "A {big, blue} {cat, dog}" => ["A big cat", "a big dog", "a blue cat", "a blue dog"]. This obviously can generate a LOT of images.

Secondly
===

I'm using it to generate images for custom versions of the SET game where data on the card's four varying aspects is conveyed via other methods than the traditional shape, number, color shading. In this case, by subject, location, plot, and art style, of images generated by dalle3. It's super fun! Fingers crossed that it actually results in something playable.
