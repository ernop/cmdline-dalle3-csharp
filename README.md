### Next version

* refactoring stuff, mainly fixing reporting and progress of how things work
* splitting out a bunch of stuff from program.cs
* mainly about reporting progress as you go, preparing for things like "if a prompt section has failed 100% of the time on a certain option, even after trying like 10 times, you should probably just quit that one."
  * and even more cool stuff later like iteratively adjusting prompts.
  * i.e. initial prompt => 10 images => gptvision them => extract phrases from that into original => iterate
  * and automatically picking up on old threads
  * kind of like there is a huge stack of frames and at each frame you can go back, put it to the bottom of the pile, or make descendants? but there has got to be lots of crossover, which will mess this up.
* Can I put in stuff about cost? so if you are going to make a call that's going to cost like more than 20$, get you to confirm? configurable obv

# Updated Usage

```
Format------ 'Dalle3.exe [-N] [-r] [-h|v] [-hd] [prompt]'
Example-------- 'Dalle3.exe A very {big,blue,tall} photo of a [tall,small] [1-2,cat,dog,mouse monster] i the stylue of {GPTArtstyles}'

Explanation of terms:
        N =                     number of times to repeat prompt. Will die if any fail. Prompt can be multiple words with no quotes required, but no newlines.
        -r =                    output items in random order. default or missing, will output in permutation order. This applies to both permutations and powersets. So without -r you will iterate through all subsets in order.
        -h|v =                  make image horizontal or vertical. the default is square.
        -hd =                   make image in hd. The default is standard, and is cheaper.
        {X,Y,Z,...} =           pick one of these and run with it, just one.
        [X,Y,Z,...] =           powerset operator. two ways to use it: either the first item is in the form A-B where it will pick between A and B items from the list,
        {GPTArtstyles} =        this will pick one of the ~450 artstyles hardcoded into the program. There are a ton of them from all over the world. The program has LOTS of aliases built in
for all kinds of different things. These are useful for forcing the program to get out of the normal vectors. But there are SO many ways to go, I'm still finding out more and more.
        Prompt =                Your text input from the command line. Or, you can edit the file OverridePrompt and run it that way so you can debug, step through etc.
or if you omit that, like in [tall,small], it will pick a random element of the powerset. reminder: powerset means ALL subsets, so everything from none of the items, to 1, to 2, ... to all of them.
Note that for powersets that is a LOT of images. 2^N where N is the number of items in the powerset. Also this is broken right now...
 by default outputs normal and annotated versions of images. If you want no normal do '-nonormal', if you want no annotated do '-noann'```

# Todos
* don't re-send repeatedly blocked prompts upstream, but make this configurable
* show you how much each run is going to cost, including -h -hd etc.
* dynamically avoid words/phrases/expansions which tend to be blocked
* figure out if you are charged for requests which end up getting blocked, and if it varies by which stage you are blocked at?

# Version 1.1 2024.02.10

redoing the way we calculate permutations, etc.

```{a,b,c} => this is a normal permutation guy.
{a boy} => this is really more like an abbreviation for a long description like "a boy with a hound dog puppy, holding a strand of wheat and looking into the distance"
{a boy, a horse} => a permutation prompt section with abbreviations in it.
[a, b, c] => this is a powerset guy (and also probably needs embedded min/maxes, too. hmm) Am I going the right direction here, 
making crazy complex command line control mechanisms?

okay, the problem is that I have both {a} => "longer version of A"
AND I have {a} => {b,c,d}
AND I have {b,c,d} => {"Longer a","longer b",..} and it's not clear what priority they should be being done in.

# cmdline-dalle3-csharp

Two functions:
===

It can conveniently contact dalle3 and make images for you on the command line.

It can take options like --N to make multiple at a time.

It can also expand permutations like "A {big, blue} {cat, dog}" => ["A big cat", "a big dog", "a blue cat", "a blue dog"]. This obviously can generate a LOT of images.

Secondly
===

I'm using it to generate images for custom versions of the SET game where data on the card's four varying aspects is conveyed via other methods than the traditional shape, number, color shading. In this case, by subject, location, plot, and art style, of images generated by dalle3. It's super fun! Fingers crossed that it actually results in something playable.

Usage
-------

```

"Dalle3.exe [-N] [-r] [-h|v] [-hd] [prompt]

> dalle3.exe A very {big,blue,tall} photo of a {tall,small} {cat,dog,mouse monster}

N=number of times to repeat prompt. Will die if any fail. Prompt can be multiple words with no quotes required, but no newlines." +
{}=run all permutations of the items within here. This can blow up your api limits.
-r output items in random order. default or missing, will output in permutation order.
by default outputs normal and annotated versions of images. If you want no normal do '-nonormal', if you want no annotated do '-noann'
-h|v make image horizontal or vertical. the default is square.
-hd make image in hd. The default is standard, and is cheaper.

```
