redoing the way we calculate permutations, etc.

```{a,b,c} => this is a normal permutation guy.
{a boy} => this is really more like an abbreviation for a long description like "a boy with a hound dog puppy, holding a strand of wheat and looking into the distance"
{a boy, a horse} => a permutation prompt section with abbreviations in it.
[a, b, c] => this is a powerset guy (and also probably needs embedded min/maxes, too. hmm) Am I going the right direction here, 
making crazy complex command line control mechanisms?

okay, the problem is that I have both {a} => "longer version of A"
AND I have {a} => {b,c,d}
AND I have {b,c,d} => {"Longer a","longer b",..} and it's not clear what priority they should be being done in.

# cmdline-dalle3-csharp

Two functions:
===

It can conveniently contact dalle3 and make images for you on the command line.

It can take options like --N to make multiple at a time.

It can also expand permutations like "A {big, blue} {cat, dog}" => ["A big cat", "a big dog", "a blue cat", "a blue dog"]. This obviously can generate a LOT of images.

Secondly
===

I'm using it to generate images for custom versions of the SET game where data on the card's four varying aspects is conveyed via other methods than the traditional shape, number, color shading. In this case, by subject, location, plot, and art style, of images generated by dalle3. It's super fun! Fingers crossed that it actually results in something playable.

Usage
-------

```

"Dalle3.exe [-N] [-r] [-h|v] [-hd] [prompt]

> dalle3.exe A very {big,blue,tall} photo of a {tall,small} {cat,dog,mouse monster}

N=number of times to repeat prompt. Will die if any fail. Prompt can be multiple words with no quotes required, but no newlines." +
{}=run all permutations of the items within here. This can blow up your api limits.
-r output items in random order. default or missing, will output in permutation order.
by default outputs normal and annotated versions of images. If you want no normal do '-nonormal', if you want no annotated do '-noann'
-h|v make image horizontal or vertical. the default is square.
-hd make image in hd. The default is standard, and is cheaper.

```
