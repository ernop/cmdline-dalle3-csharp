//@"{To explore the link between cultic thought patterns and the hype around LK-99, we can delve into how elements of cultic behavior can manifest in scientific communities and public reactions to purported discoveries.,,    Belief in Superior Knowledge: Just as cults often center around esoteric knowledge accessible only to initiates, the initial excitement around LK-99 was partly driven by the allure of cutting-edge scientific discovery. The promise of a room-temperature superconductor represents a kind of ""hidden"" knowledge that could revolutionize technology, drawing individuals into a narrative that feels both exclusive and transformative.,,    Us vs. Them Mentality: In cultic frameworks, there's often a clear division between those within the group who ""know"" and the outsiders who either don't understand or are actively working against the group's interests. With LK-99, skepticism from the broader scientific community could be perceived by true believers as suppression of revolutionary science by a conservative establishment, reinforcing an ""us vs. them"" dynamic.,,    Infallibility of the Prophets: Cult leaders are often seen as infallible figures whose teachings cannot be questioned. Similarly, the researchers behind LK-99 might be elevated to a similar status by enthusiasts, where their findings are beyond reproach. Attempts to replicate the results that fail could be dismissed as flawed or biased, rather than legitimate scientific inquiry.,,    Salvation Myth: Cults often promise some form of salvation or enlightenment. The narrative around LK-99 offered the technological salvation of humanity—solving energy crises, revolutionizing transport, and more. The fervor with which these outcomes are anticipated can mirror the cultic belief in a utopian future.,,    Shunning Doubt: Just as cults discourage or punish doubt among their followers, communities that form around unverified scientific claims like LK-99 may ostracize or ridicule members who question the validity of the discovery. This creates an environment where critical thinking is stifled, and belief is maintained through social pressure.,,    Ritualistic Repetition: While not involving rituals in the traditional sense, the propagation of claims about LK-99 involves the repeated sharing of information, articles, and social media posts. This echo chamber effect reinforces beliefs within the community, similar to how ritual repetition in cults reinforces commitment to the group's beliefs.,,    Apocalyptic Urgency: Many cults operate under a sense of impending doom that only they can avert. The discourse around breakthroughs like LK-99 can sometimes carry a similar urgency—this discovery must be pursued and accepted to prevent future crises, pushing followers towards more fervent advocacy.,,    Disillusionment and Rationalization: When faced with incontrovertible evidence against their beliefs, cult members may experience disillusionment but then engage in rationalization to reconcile their beliefs with reality. Similarly, as efforts to replicate LK-99's results fail, true believers may rationalize these failures in a way that allows them to maintain their belief in the discovery's significance.,,The LK-99 situation, while grounded in a scientific inquiry, shows how the psychological dynamics common in cults can also appear in other areas of human endeavor. The intense emotional investment, communal reinforcement, and resistance to external critique that characterize cultic thought can emerge around scientific discoveries when the promise of revolutionary change intersects with human hope, desire, and the innate yearning for progress.}"

//"I live in a rural farming area in medieval norway. We do not think or worry about race, ethnicity or anything, and never mention or care about it. We are all subjects to our king. Let me tell you a story which began when I saw a beholder giving psychotherapy to a line of people! The horrible round floating monster was encased in a prismatic sphere of protection, although I do not know whether it was to protect the people, or to protect the beholder, Can you imagine how this may have happened? Do you know about beholders? \r\nThey are huge, monstrously evil floating spheres made of a hard material, with ten eye stalks, each topped with an eye with a unique powerful ray. It has a horrible mouth and eyes; they are born from the evil dreams of other creatures and pop into reality, immensely paranoid, intelligent, relentlessly plotting and scheming, always evil, and a blight. How is it that the one I saw appeared to be caring, gentle, and helping people? This rural, uneducated, yet perceptive man continues to tell you the story - here is the overview: \r\n\r\nmonday - rumors of a healer or helper who yet appears like a beholder in town square\r\ntues many visited square and indeed its true, there is a beholder there speaking kindly to many\r\nweds rumors spread and the intensity increases; some farmers leave others come closer, all are roused with emotion, some love, some fear, hate, even worship, others doubt. Thurs - some people disappear, left, or worse? beholder's flaws apparent yet worship increases, are they just doubting? beholder issues new laws and rules, fri - confrontation with king, wizard, knight, nursemaid, or townspeople - anger and violence - saturday beholder dead in field, killed by we know not who. all sleep, ponder, regret, sorry - sunday - we rebuild our towns and our spirits, king's speech, hope and regret, shame, trust loss of faith what really happened here? we still do not know.  \r\n\r\nNow, you pick ONE day, ONLY the day: \r\n{monday,,tuesday,,wednesday,,thursday,,friday,,saturday,,sunday}. Imagine deeply how a single farmer might experience this day - what we would see, feel, experience. Once you have decided that, pick a single part of the day, and describe that in maximum specificity including where he was, what he saw and hear in exact quotes, how things looked, etc. imagine a highly detailed scene from within this complex story.  Output only the description of a single image of that scene in high clear sharp detail.  \r\n\r\nDo not just repeat the example I gave. Make it really different, with twists and turns, such as those created by the amazing diverse director M Night Shyamalan. The scenes all take place in medieval fantasy england where nobody ever talks about or mentions race, so neither should you. The only people there are norse. Start each description with the day of the week. use illustrative adjectives and rare words, detailed depictions of color, style, texture, lighting to please the eye and emotions. Use complex plots and cunning double-meanings to enlighten the single image you craete.  "

Nearby, an ancient astrolabe and an almanac sit atop an alabaster shelf, suggesting the artist's interest in astronomy and the passage of time.

Around the amphitheatre are autumnal aspens, arranged aesthetically above awnings., adding an autumnal allure to the arrangement. The atmosphere around the albatross artist and the amphitheatre is absolutely awe-inspiring.' EVALUATION: AMAZING job, attaboy! add lots of THINGS and objects with the letter, so it's easy to guess!  Now, the next step YOUR job: pick a RANDOM letter of the alphabet. Once you do that, make out a cool and funny phrase which describes SOMETHING that stars with that letter, in a place which also starts with that letter, and also is described with an adjective that also starts with that letter! You can do it, I know, just make sure to repeatedly use the letter as much as possible and choose interesting and cool things, like animals, people, cars, and great locations or situations! ALSO, go back and add a bunch more specific nouns to the picture, its all about nouns, nouns the focus. The image should just be overloaded completely with objects whose name begins with that letter!"

//"an exasperated, older south korean scientist is giving a talk called \"I can fly, at will, at any time\" as it says on the large board. He is older, about 60, slightly greying, A Korean man.  He stands at the podium reviewing slides. Many people in the audience are observing. This slide has a very complicated, equation on top, a blurry photo, and on the bottom, he has the line \"Q. E. D. Autonomous, at-will, flight\". He does not acknowledge the unusual aspect of his talk for even a moment- that if he really could do that, he could trivially demonstrate it, simply by rising up and flying for a moment. The equations are interesting, but when the core interesting aspect of the claim is both so extreme, and so easy to demonstrate, it is also appropriate to use the direct demonstration method. The image is of after the presentation is over - he never actually flew, despite claiming it was trivial and easy. The audience is extremely disappointed and begins to grumble and resist, and confront himself. What do you think he would do? Run away, flee, yell, rage, hide? It's a mix. ",

The upward curves of the eyes and mouth symbolize the exchange of virtual gluons, the mediators of the strong force, while the underscore represents the confinement of quarks within the hadrons themselves. Furthermore, the emotional resonance of UwU can be understood as a manifestation of the color confinement principle, wherein the emotional \"charge\" of cuteness is unable to exist in isolation, much like individual quarks.
